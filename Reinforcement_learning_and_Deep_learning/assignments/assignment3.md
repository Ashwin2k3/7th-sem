# Assignment 3: Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks

## Question 1: Define Multilayer Perceptron and Deep Neural Network

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

A **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in the MLP is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer, forming a fully connected architecture. MLPs are capable of learning complex functions and are used for various tasks, including classification and regression.

#### Key Features of MLPs:
- **Feedforward Architecture**: Information flows in one direction, from input to output.
- **Non-linearity**: MLPs use activation functions (like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh) to introduce non-linearity, allowing them to model complex patterns.
- **Backpropagation**: The learning process involves adjusting weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs using the backpropagation algorithm.

### Deep Neural Network (DNN)

A **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** is an extension of MLPs, characterized by having multiple hidden layers (more than two). The depth of the network allows DNNs to capture hierarchical features and complex representations in data. DNNs are widely used in various applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.

#### Key Features of DNNs:
- **Depth**: The presence of multiple hidden layers enables the network to learn intricate patterns and features.
- **Representation Learning**: DNNs automatically learn to represent data in different levels of abstraction.
- **Scalability**: DNNs can scale to large datasets, making them suitable for big data applications.

## Question 2: Explain Activation Function and Its Working with the Help of a Diagram

An **activation function** is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron in a neural network. It determines whether a neuron should be activated or not, thereby introducing non-linearity into the model. Without activation functions, a neural network would essentially behave like a linear model, limiting its ability to learn complex patterns.

### Common Activation Functions:
1. **Sigmoid**: 
   - Formula: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \)
   - Output range: (0, 1)
   - Used mainly in binary classification problems.

2. **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**:
   - Formula: \( f(x) = \tanh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} \)
   - Output range: (-1, 1)
   - Provides better convergence compared to sigmoid.

3. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**:
   - Formula: \( f(x) = \max(0, x) \)
   - Output range: [0, âˆž)
   - Widely used in hidden layers of deep networks due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

### Diagram Explanation:
- The x-axis represents the input value (x) to the activation function.
- The y-axis represents the output value (f(x)).
- Each curve illustrates how different activation functions transform the input signal to an output signal. The non-linear nature of the activation functions allows neural networks to learn complex mappings from input to output.

## Question 3: Discuss CNN and Its Layers in Detail

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. CNNs leverage spatial hierarchies by using a series of convolutional layers to extract features from the input data, making them particularly effective for image classification and object detection tasks.

### Key Layers of CNNs:

1. **Convolutional Layer**:
   - The core building block of CNNs.
   - Applies convolution operations to the input data using learnable filters (kernels).
   - Extracts local features by sliding filters over the input and producing feature maps.
   - Helps in reducing the dimensionality of the input.

2. **Activation Function**:
   - Typically, a non-linear activation function (like ReLU) is applied to the output of the convolutional layer.
   - Introduces non-linearity to the model.

3. **Pooling Layer**:
   - Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thereby decreasing the computational complexity.
   - Common types include Max Pooling (takes the maximum value in a window) and Average Pooling (takes the average value).
   - Helps to make the model invariant to small translations of the input.

4. **Fully Connected Layer**:
   - After several convolutional and pooling layers, the output is flattened and passed to one or more fully connected layers.
   - These layers learn to map the features extracted by the convolutional layers to the output classes (e.g., classification tasks).

5. **Output Layer**:
   - The final layer, usually a fully connected layer, which outputs the predicted class probabilities.
   - Often uses a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

### Diagram Explanation:
- The input layer receives the raw pixel values of the image.
- Convolutional layers apply multiple filters to extract features.
- Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of feature maps.
- The fully connected layers aggregate the learned features and produce the final classification output.
