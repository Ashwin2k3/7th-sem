# Assignment 4: Continuous Skip-Gram Model, Image Segmentation, and Continuous Bag-of-Words Model

## Question 1: Define Continuous Skip-Gram Model

The **Continuous Skip-Gram Model** is a neural network-based approach used for word embedding in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is part of the Word2Vec framework, introduced by Mikolov et al. in 2013. The Skip-Gram model aims to predict the surrounding context words given a target word, thereby capturing the semantic relationships between words in a continuous vector space.

### Key Features:
- **Objective**: The model maximizes the probability of context words given a target word. For a given word \( w_t \) and its context words \( w_{t-n}, \ldots, w_{t+n} \) (where \( n \) is the window size), the goal is to maximize:
  
  \[
  P(w_{t-n}, \ldots, w_{t+n} | w_t)
  \]

- **Architecture**: The model consists of an input layer representing the target word and an output layer representing the probability distribution of context words. The hidden layer contains the word embeddings.
  
- **Training**: The training process adjusts the word vectors to increase the likelihood of observing the context words for a given target word, leading to embeddings that capture semantic similarities (e.g., "king" and "queen" would have similar embeddings).

### Applications:
- Text classification
- Information retrieval
- Sentiment analysis

## Question 2: Explain Image Segmentation and Object Detection

### Image Segmentation

**Image Segmentation** is a computer vision technique that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify its representation. The primary goal of segmentation is to locate and identify objects within an image.

#### Types of Image Segmentation:
1. **Semantic Segmentation**: Each pixel in the image is classified into a specific category (e.g., road, car, pedestrian). The output is a pixel-wise mask indicating the class of each pixel.
2. **Instance Segmentation**: Similar to semantic segmentation, but it also differentiates between separate instances of the same class (e.g., distinguishing between two different cars).

#### Techniques:
- Thresholding
- Clustering methods (e.g., K-means)
- Deep learning approaches (e.g., Fully Convolutional Networks)

### Object Detection

**Object Detection** is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image. Unlike image segmentation, which focuses on classifying pixels, object detection provides bounding boxes around detected objects along with class labels.

#### Techniques:
1. **Traditional Methods**: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), Haar Cascades.
2. **Deep Learning Methods**: 
   - **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A real-time object detection system that predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.
   - **Faster R-CNN**: Combines Region Proposal Networks (RPN) with Fast R-CNN for efficient object detection.

### Applications:
- Autonomous vehicles
- Video surveillance
- Robotics
- Augmented reality

## Question 3: Discuss Continuous Bag-of-Words Model

The **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) Model** is another approach in the Word2Vec framework, designed for learning word embeddings in NLP. In contrast to the Skip-Gram model, CBOW predicts the target word based on its context words.

### Key Features:
- **Objective**: The model aims to maximize the probability of predicting the target word \( w_t \) given its context words \( w_{t-n}, \ldots, w_{t+n} \). The objective can be expressed as:

  \[
  P(w_t | w_{t-n}, \ldots, w_{t+n})
  \]

- **Architecture**: The model consists of an input layer representing context words and an output layer representing the probability distribution of the target word. The hidden layer contains the word embeddings for both the context and target words.

- **Training**: During training, the model adjusts the embeddings to improve the prediction accuracy of the target word based on the surrounding context, effectively capturing semantic relationships.

### Applications:
- Similar to the Skip-Gram model, CBOW is used for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and recommendation systems. 

### Comparison with Skip-Gram:
- **Input**: CBOW uses context words as input to predict the target word, while Skip-Gram uses the target word to predict context words.
- **Performance**: CBOW tends to be faster and works better with smaller datasets, while Skip-Gram performs better on larger datasets with rare words.
