### Program 3: Lamport's Logical Clock Implementation

#### Aim
To implement Lamport's Logical Clock in Java, allowing multiple processes to communicate with each other while maintaining a consistent ordering of events.

#### Theory
Lamport's Logical Clock is a mechanism for capturing the order of events in a distributed system. It assigns a timestamp to each event, allowing systems to determine the order of events based on these timestamps. This is particularly useful in distributed systems where there is no global clock.

### Source Code

#### 1. Process Class
```java
// Process.java
import java.util.Random;

public class Process {
    private int id;
    private int logicalClock;

    public Process(int id) {
        this.id = id;
        this.logicalClock = 0; // Initialize logical clock to 0
    }

    public void sendMessage(Process receiver) {
        logicalClock++; // Increment logical clock on sending a message
        System.out.println("Process " + id + " sends message at logical clock: " + logicalClock);
        receiver.receiveMessage(logicalClock); // Send the logical clock value to the receiver
    }

    public void receiveMessage(int senderClock) {
        logicalClock = Math.max(logicalClock, senderClock) + 1; // Update logical clock on receiving a message
        System.out.println("Process " + id + " receives message at logical clock: " + logicalClock);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Main Class
```java
// LamportLogicalClock.java
public class LamportLogicalClock {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Process process1 = new Process(1);
        Process process2 = new Process(2);
        Process process3 = new Process(3);
        
        // Simulating communication between processes
        process1.sendMessage(process2);
        process2.sendMessage(process3);
        process3.sendMessage(process1);
        
        // Further communication to show logical clock behavior
        process1.sendMessage(process3);
        process2.sendMessage(process1);
    }
}
```

### Commands to Execute

1. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```bash
   javac Process.java LamportLogicalClock.java
   ```

2. **Run the Lamport Logical Clock program:**
   ```bash
   java LamportLogicalClock
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Process 1 sends message at logical clock: 1
   Process 2 receives message at logical clock: 1
   Process 2 sends message at logical clock: 2
   Process 3 receives message at logical clock: 2
   Process 3 sends message at logical clock: 3
   Process 1 receives message at logical clock: 3
   Process 1 sends message at logical clock: 4
   Process 3 receives message at logical clock: 4
   Process 2 sends message at logical clock: 5
   Process 1 receives message at logical clock: 5
   ```

### Conclusion
This practical demonstrates Lamport's Logical Clock by simulating message passing between processes. Each process maintains its logical clock and updates it according to the rules defined by Lamport's algorithm. This implementation showcases how logical clocks can be used to order events in a distributed system.

### Summary of Execution Steps
1. Compile the Java code.
2. Run the main program to see the logical clock behavior during message passing between processes.
