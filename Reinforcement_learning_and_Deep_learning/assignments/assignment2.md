# Assignment 2: Reinforcement Learning

## Question 1: Define Policy-Based Methods in Reinforcement Learning

**Policy-Based Methods** in Reinforcement Learning (RL) focus on directly learning a policy that maps states to actions without requiring a value function. These methods optimize the policy by adjusting its parameters based on the feedback received from the environment in the form of rewards. Policy-based methods are particularly useful in environments with high-dimensional action spaces or when the action space is continuous.

### Key Characteristics of Policy-Based Methods:

1. **Policy Representation**: The policy can be deterministic (a fixed action for a given state) or stochastic (a probability distribution over actions).

2. **Gradient Ascent**: These methods typically use gradient ascent to optimize the expected reward by following the policy gradient. The policy gradient theorem provides a way to calculate gradients of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters.

3. **Exploration**: Policy-based methods inherently explore the action space by sampling actions according to the policy, which can lead to better exploration in complex environments.

4. **Continuous Action Spaces**: They are well-suited for problems with continuous action spaces where value-based methods may struggle.

5. **Stability**: Policy-based methods can be more stable in some environments, especially when using techniques like trust region optimization.

### Advantages and Disadvantages:

- **Advantages**:
  - Can learn stochastic policies.
  - Suitable for large or continuous action spaces.
  - Directly optimize the policy.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Often have high variance in policy gradient estimates.
  - Can require more samples to converge compared to value-based methods.

## Question 2: Explain Q-Learning, Justify with an Example

**Q-Learning** is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to learn the value of an action in a particular state. The goal of Q-Learning is to find the optimal policy by learning the action-value function, which gives the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state.

### Q-Learning Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialize** the Q-table with arbitrary values (often zero).
2. For each episode:
   - Initialize the starting state.
   - For each step in the episode:
     - Choose an action using an exploration strategy (e.g., ε-greedy).
     - Take the action and observe the reward and next state.
     - Update the Q-value using the formula:
       \[
       Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
       \]
       where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate, \( r \) is the reward, \( \gamma \) is the discount factor, \( s \) is the current state, \( a \) is the action taken, and \( s' \) is the next state.
3. **Repeat** until convergence or a maximum number of episodes is reached.

### Example:

Consider a simple grid world where an agent starts at the bottom-left corner (0,0) and needs to reach the top-right corner (4,4). The agent receives a reward of +10 for reaching the target and -1 for each move taken. Initially, the Q-values for each state-action pair are set to zero.

- The agent begins exploring the grid using the ε-greedy strategy, occasionally taking random actions to discover their effects.
- As the agent learns from its interactions with the environment, it updates the Q-values. For example, if the agent moves right to (0,1) and receives a reward of -1, the Q-value for that state-action pair is updated accordingly.
- After several episodes of exploration and updating the Q-values, the agent learns that the best path from (0,0) to (4,4) is to move right (R) and then up (U). The learned Q-values guide the agent to choose actions that maximize rewards.

## Question 3: Compare and Contrast A2C and A3C

| **Feature**                       | **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**                  | **A3C (Asynchronous Actor-Critic)**                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**                  | Utilizes a single agent that learns concurrently using the advantage function for more stable updates. | Employs multiple agents running in parallel to explore different parts of the state space simultaneously. |
| **Learning Method**               | Updates the policy and value function after each action taken, using the advantage function to reduce variance. | Updates the policy and value function asynchronously based on experiences gathered by multiple agents. |
| **Exploration Strategy**          | Usually relies on a stochastic policy for exploration. | Utilizes diverse exploration strategies across multiple agents to cover a broader range of states. |
| **Sample Efficiency**             | Can be less sample-efficient due to learning from a single agent. | More sample-efficient since multiple agents share experience and contribute to learning. |
| **Stability**                     | Generally more stable than traditional policy gradient methods due to the advantage function. | Provides higher stability and faster convergence due to asynchronous updates and exploration. |
| **Implementation Complexity**     | Simpler to implement as it operates with a single agent. | More complex due to the coordination of multiple agents and the handling of asynchronous updates. |

### Conclusion

Both A2C and A3C are powerful reinforcement learning algorithms that utilize the actor-critic framework. A2C is simpler and more stable, focusing on learning from a single agent, while A3C leverages the benefits of multiple agents exploring the environment concurrently, leading to more efficient learning. The choice between them often depends on the specific application and computational resources available.
