### Aim
To install Google App Engine and develop a simple web application that responds to HTTP requests, demonstrating the basic functionality and deployment of applications on Google Cloud Platform.

### Theory
**Google App Engine (GAE)** is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that allows developers to build and host applications on Google's infrastructure. It supports multiple programming languages and provides a fully managed environment, which means that Google handles server management, scaling, and load balancing automatically.

#### Key Features of Google App Engine:
- **Automatic Scaling**: GAE automatically scales your application up or down based on incoming traffic.
- **Built-in Services**: Provides built-in services for data storage, user autheP0+r\P0+r\P0+r\P0+r\P0+r\ntication, and other functionalities.
- **Flexible Environment**: Supports custom runtimes and libraries, allowing developers to use the tools they are most comfortable with.

### Source Code

In this example, we will create a simple "Hello, World!" web application using Python and Flask.

#### Step 1: Install Google Cloud SDK
To interact with Google Cloud services, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK. You can do this by following these steps:

```bash
# Download the Google Cloud SDK installer
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

# Restart your terminal or run the following command to initialize the SDK
exec -l $SHELL

# Initialize the Google Cloud SDK
gcloud init
```

#### Step 2: Install Flask
Flask is a micro web framework for Python. Install Flask using pip:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install Flask
pip install Flask
```

#### Step 3: Create the Web Application
Create a directory for your application and create a file named `app.py`:

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
touch app.py
```

Add the following code to `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=True)
```

#### Step 4: Create the App Engine Configuration File
Create a file named `app.yaml` in the same directory with the following content:

```yaml
runtime: python310

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: auto
```

### Steps to Deploy the Application

1. **Run the Application Locally**:
   Before deploying, you can test your application locally:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. You should see "Hello, World!".

2. **Deploy the Application to Google App Engine**:
   Use the following command to deploy your application:

   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

3. **Access Your Application**:
   After deployment, you can access your application using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcloud app browse
   ```

   This will open your default web browser with the URL of your deployed application.

### Output
Upon accessing your application in the web browser, you should see:

```
Hello, World!
```

### Conclusion
By installing Google App Engine and developing a simple web application, we have demonstrated the ease of deploying applications on Google Cloud Platform. GAE abstracts the underlying infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on writing code. This experience serves as a foundation for building more complex applications in the cloud using various Google Cloud services.
