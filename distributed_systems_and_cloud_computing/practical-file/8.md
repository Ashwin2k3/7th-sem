### Aim
To launch a web application using Google App Engine (GAE), demonstrating the deployment process and basic functionality of applications on Google Cloud Platform.

### Theory
**Google App Engine (GAE)** is a cloud computing platform that allows developers to build and host web applications in Google-managed data centers. It supports several programming languages and provides automatic scaling, load balancing, and built-in services, making it easier for developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure.

#### Key Features of Google App Engine:
- **Automatic Scaling**: GAE automatically scales applications based on traffic.
- **Managed Services**: Offers built-in services such as data storage and user authentication.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports languages like Python, Java, Go, Node.js, and PHP.
- **Integrated Developer Tools**: Easy integration with other Google Cloud services for data storage, logging, and monitoring.

### Source Code

In this example, we will create and launch a simple web application using Python and Flask.

#### Step 1: Install Google Cloud SDK
Install the Google Cloud SDK to interact with Google Cloud services:

```bash
# Download and install the Google Cloud SDK
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

# Restart your terminal or run the following command to initialize the SDK
exec -l $SHELL

# Initialize the Google Cloud SDK
gcloud init
```

#### Step 2: Install Flask
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. Install it using pip:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install Flask
pip install Flask
```

#### Step 3: Create the Web Application
Create a directory for your application and create a file named `main.py`:

```bash
mkdir my-web-app
cd my-web-app
touch main.py
```

Add the following code to `main.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to My Web Application on Google App Engine!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=True)
```

#### Step 4: Create the App Engine Configuration File
Create a file named `app.yaml` in the same directory with the following content:

```yaml
runtime: python310

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: auto
```

### Steps to Deploy the Application

1. **Run the Application Locally**:
   Before deploying, you can test your application locally by running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. You should see:

   ```
   Welcome to My Web Application on Google App Engine!
   ```

2. **Deploy the Application to Google App Engine**:
   Use the following command to deploy your application:

   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

   You may be prompted to select a project and confirm the deployment.

3. **Access Your Application**:
   After deployment, you can access your application using:

   ```bash
   gcloud app browse
   ```

   This command will open your default web browser with the URL of your deployed application.

### Output
Upon accessing your application in the web browser, you should see:

```
Welcome to My Web Application on Google App Engine!
```

### Conclusion
By launching a web application using Google App Engine, we have demonstrated the straightforward deployment process and the advantages of using GAE for hosting applications. This experience illustrates the power of cloud computing in simplifying application deployment and management, allowing developers to focus on creating and enhancing their applications. GAE provides a robust foundation for building scalable and resilient web applications in the cloud.
