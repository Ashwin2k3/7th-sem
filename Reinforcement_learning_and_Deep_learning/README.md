### Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and Its Terms

1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: RL is a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.
2. **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker in RL that interacts with the environment by taking actions.
3. **Environment**: The system or world the agent interacts with, providing feedback in the form of rewards based on the agent’s actions.
4. **State**: A representation of the environment’s current situation as observed by the agent, which may be fully or partially observable.
5. **Action**: The decision or move the agent makes at any given time step, which affects the environment and leads to new states.
6. **Reward**: A numerical value provided by the environment as feedback after each action, indicating the immediate benefit of the agent's action.
7. **Policy (π)**: A strategy that defines how the agent selects actions based on states, either deterministically or stochastically.
8. **Value Function**: A function that estimates the expected cumulative reward (or value) of being in a particular state or taking a specific action.
9. **Episode**: A sequence of interactions between the agent and the environment that starts from an initial state and ends in a terminal state or predefined condition.
10. **Discount Factor (γ)**: A parameter that determines the importance of future rewards, with values closer to 1 making future rewards more significant to the agent's decision-making process.

Here's a breakdown of each topic related to Reinforcement Learning (RL), with 10 points under each heading:

### **1. Features and Elements of Reinforcement Learning (RL):**

4. **Environment:** The world through which the agent moves and interacts.
5. **State:** The current situation or observation the agent perceives from the environment.
6. **Action:** The choices or moves made by the agent at each step.
7. **Policy:** The strategy or mapping from states to actions that the agent follows.
8. **Value function:** Estimates how good it is for the agent to be in a given state or how valuable a particular state is.
9. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** The trade-off between exploring new actions to learn more and exploiting current knowledge to maximize reward.
10. **Delayed rewards:** Actions may have long-term consequences, meaning the reward could be delayed over time.

### **2. Defining RL Framework and Markov Decision Process (MDP):**
1. **MDP formulation:** RL problems are framed as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
2. **MDP Components:** MDP consists of states, actions, rewards, and transition probabilities.
3. **Markov Property:** The future state depends only on the current state and action, not the past states (memoryless property).
4. **State transition function:** Specifies the probability of moving from one state to another given a certain action.
5. **Reward function:** Maps each action and state transition to a numerical reward.
6. **Discount factor (γ):** Determines the importance of future rewards (values between 0 and 1).
7. **Horizon:** Time horizon refers to whether the agent is dealing with finite or infinite steps.
8. **Objective:** The agent’s goal is to maximize the cumulative (discounted) reward over time.
9. **Optimal policy in MDP:** The policy that maximizes the expected return (reward) from every state.
10. **Bellman equations:** Used to compute the value functions in MDP, setting the foundation for solving RL problems.

---

### **3. Policies:**
1. **Policy definition:** A policy is a mapping from states to actions, guiding the agent’s behavior.
2. **Deterministic policy:** A policy where each state maps to a single action (e.g., π(s) = a).
3. **Stochastic policy:** A policy where each state maps to a probability distribution over actions (π(a|s)).
4. **Optimal policy:** The policy that maximizes the expected sum of rewards.
5. **Policy iteration:** An algorithm to find the optimal policy by improving policies iteratively.
6. **On-policy learning:** The agent learns the policy that it is currently using.
7. **Off-policy learning:** The agent learns a policy different from the one it is currently following.
8. **Exploration policy:** A policy that favors actions that have not been tried much (e.g., ε-greedy).
9. **Greedy policy:** A policy that always selects the action with the highest expected reward.
10. **Policy gradient methods:** Algorithms that optimize the policy directly by following the gradient of expected reward.

---

### **4. Value Functions and Bellman Equations:**
1. **Value function (V):** Predicts the total reward an agent can expect to collect starting from a given state.
2. **State-value function V(s):** The expected return starting from state `s` and following policy `π`.
3. **Action-value function Q(s, a):** The expected return starting from state `s`, taking action `a`, and following policy `π`.
4. **Optimal value function (V*):** The maximum value function achievable by any policy from a given state.
5. **Optimal action-value function (Q*):** The maximum expected return after taking an action and following the optimal policy.
6. **Bellman equation for V:** Breaks down the value of a state into immediate reward plus the discounted value of the next state.
